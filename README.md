NeuralODEs are new class of deep learning architectures aimed towards robustness and better explainability of Deep learning models. These are continuous time Deep learning architectures, a generalization of their discrete models (ResNets).   

## Basic Navigation:
* `models` directory contains the architectures of different models implemented
* `script` contains the bash scripts to run the model with different configurations(or hyperparameters)
* `data` contains the scripts for prepararing dataset and preprocessing of dataset
* `Example-Notebook` has pre-trained experiments and visualization of results
